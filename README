Wandrbae is a platform where users can sign up for rides on routes that have been approved by admin also known as Route Scouts.

Features include user authentication (login/signup/logout)
Members only can view routes and rides, and signup/ cancel participation in a ride
Admin can view the userlist and create, edit, delete, view users

Routes use javascript to draw a line on a map to show the route, using waypoints added in the database to create the route.

Implementation:
Download the SQL and project files from Github and go to town~

This Project uses
PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Other tools used: Procreate, dbdiagram.io for the schema design

Images used:
Bicycle by Pixabay user MaBras
logo and logo1 created by myself using Procreate


Future improvements:
Route Scouts can record routes and notate route features
Superadmin user level for managing admin
